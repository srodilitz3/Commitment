# Commitment
Code for simulations in "Commitment on Crowdsourcing Platforms: Implications for Growth and Engagement" (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3802628)

This .ipynb file is intended for use in a Jupyter notebook. It requires the packages: numpy, matplotlib, and time

The file contains a number of methods that are the basis for tables and figures in the paper. The current version of the code runs reasonably efficiently (~10 minutes), though to reproduce the granularity of the figures in the paper, certain arguments need to be changed (which would increase the runtime). See the comments within the code for additional details.

We note that the FRUS data is not included, as it is proprietary. The provided code conducts simulations using the examples (e.g., settings and parameters) described in the paper.
